Tech used:
Javascript, Handlebars, and jQuery was used to form the table and functionality of the buttons. Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL was used on the back end to store and pull data.

general approach:
The very first thing I thought about was what I wanted to make. After some time I decided to create a site where a person could log into their account and track their one rep max for weight lifting and write notes for themselves. This way a user could record and view their progress while writing notes to themselves about it. I wanted a table that was easily editiable so I made it into a form with buttons that corresponds to each row.

User Stories:
The user base for this site would be those that would like to track their gains or losses for the most weight they can lift in one repetition. The reason why this should be recorded is to measure progress and help strategize of how to improve that max weight. For example if a person one rep max for bicep is 80 pounds, there is a formula to improve on that you should be able to do 2 reps at 95% of your one rep max, 3 reps at 93% etc.
As a user I want to record my one rep max to measure gains and losses.
As a user I want to update stats for each week in case I need to make a correction.
As a user I want to delete stats for each week in case I make a mistake
As a user I want to leave a note for myself about each week to see why I might have done better or worse compared to others.

wireframes:

Unsolved problems:
Need to figure out a way to have each row update data that is inputted.
